# BrickBreaker_Advanced Public

This project is a Brick Breaker game designed to practice and demonstrate advanced C++ concepts and modern programming techniques. It uses the **SFML** library for graphics and incorporates cutting-edge C++ features to ensure robust, efficient, and clean code.

## Features

### Modern C++ Practices
- **Smart Pointers**: Leveraging `std::unique_ptr` for efficient memory management.
- **Move Semantics**: Implementing custom move constructors and operators for resource optimization.
- **Templates**: Creating reusable, type-safe components.
- **Abstract Classes**: Using polymorphism for flexible design.
- **`constexpr`**: Applying compile-time evaluations for performance improvements.
- **Const Correctness**: Ensuring immutability where applicable for better code clarity and safety.

### Gameplay
- Classic brick-breaking mechanics with an intuitive user interface.
- Simple physics simulation using SFML for seamless graphics.

## Requirements

- **Compiler**: A C++17 (or later) compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- **Library**: SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)

## Key Objectives

- Demonstrating the application of modern C++ features in real-world projects.
- Practicing clean and scalable architecture principles.
- Learning and integrating the SFML library for 2D graphics and interaction.

## Gameplay Instructions

- Use the arrow keys or mouse to control the paddle.
- Break all the bricks to win the level.

## Acknowledgments

- **SFML**: For providing a lightweight and powerful graphics library.
- **C++ Community**: For resources and inspiration on modern C++ practices.
